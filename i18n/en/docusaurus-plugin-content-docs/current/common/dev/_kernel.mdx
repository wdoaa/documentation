## Using bsp

BSP is a set of tools provided by Radxa to quickly build U-Boot Kernel. It is very convenient to use bsp to build your own U-Boot and Kernel.
The following will show you how to use bsp to build the kernel of Radxa ZERO 3.

### [bsp Environment configuration](https://radxa-repo.github.io/bsp/)

After completing the bsp environment configuration, you need to compile the kernel first before pulling the kernel code from the warehouse.
You can execute `./bsp linux rk356x` to build the kernel. The path to the kernel source code is located in the bsp directory. `.src/linux`

```
cd bsp
mkdir output
cd output
../bsp --no-prepare-source linux rk356x -r 20

Parameter Description:
--no-prepare-source

# Compile using local modifications. If this parameter is not added, the latest code will be synchronized from the Radxa kernel warehouse and the local modifications will be overwritten.

-r 20

# Specify the kernel version number as 20
```

For more bsp parameter usage instructions, you can execute `./bsp` to view.

After compilation is completed, many `deb` packages will be generated in the bsp/output directory. You only need to install the following two `deb` packages.

```
linux-headers-5.10.160-20-rk356x_5.10.160-20_arm64.deb
linux-image-5.10.160-20-rk356x_5.10.160-20_arm64.deb
```

Copy the above two `deb` packages to the board and use the `dpkg` command to install them to complete the kernel installation.

```
sudo dpkg -i linux-image-5.10.160-20-rk356x_5.10.160-20_arm64.deb
sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-5.10.160-20-rk356x_5.10.160-20_arm64.deb
sudo reboot
```

After the restart is complete, you can use `uname -a` to check the currently started kernel version number to see whether the installation was successful.

## Manual compilation

:::tip
`bsp` is the only compilation method that is currently supported, and it makes additional changes to the source code during the build.
If you want to develop based on our official releases, you should at least use `bsp` to download and configure the source code.

If you want to use a custom `make` command to compile, please refer to the [Prepare working tree](https://radxa-repo.github.io/bsp/dev_flow.html#prepare-working-tree) section to prepare the code.
